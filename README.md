Introduction:
This project is a basic To-Do List web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, editing, and 
deleting tasks. It includes a user-friendly interface where tasks can be marked as completed, and provides real-time counters to display the number of completed and uncompleted tasks.

CSS Styling: The code uses a custom font and styles the to-do list with a modern look, including hover effects and task-specific styles.
JavaScript Functionality:

Edit Task: Allows editing of tasks.
Delete Task: Removes tasks from the list.
